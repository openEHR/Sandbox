# Pathology modeling experiment

This subdirectory hosts an experiment regarding using a shared modeling repository for working with Archetype Designer in th eefforts described in teh discussion thread https://discourse.openehr.org/t/refreshing-archetypes-related-to-pathology-reporting/2393/78

In order to experiment with branches there will also be other branches than the default `master` branch, for example:
- `modeling-test` (see most current content of that branch in https://github.com/openEHR/Sandbox/blob/modeling-test/pathology )

(Note that branches concern the entire `sandbox` repository, not only this dierctory, but you can ignore the other directories for now.)
